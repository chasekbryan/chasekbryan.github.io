  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Chase Bryan</strong>, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at 
<strong>Colorado Technical University</strong>. I dedicate the majority of my time to expanding my understanding of computer science 
fundamentals and software engineering. Presently, I am studying from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank"> Odin Project</a> and am really enjoying manufacturing my website.</p>

  <h2>Academic and Technical Focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Frontend and backend technologies</li>
    <li><strong>Python Programming:</strong> Clean, efficient, and scalable coding</li>
    <li><strong>Core CS Topics:</strong> Algorithms, data structures, OS, systems, networking</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
  <p>My long-term goal is to become an expert software engineer, reaching a level of intellectual contribution akin to 
<strong>Donald Knuth</strong>, whose work in algorithmic analysis and literate programming has been a major inspiration to me. I am also inspired by other great computer scientists such as Linus Torvalds, Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. </p>

  <h2>My Work Ethic</h2>
  <p>I am a <strong>hard worker</strong> and a <strong>self-driven learner</strong>. I dedicate many hours to mastering new skills, 
reading technical documentation, and building projects. I believe success in this field requires discipline, curiosity, and the 
pursuit of excellence through deliberate practice. I study a little every day and sometimes for long hours throughout the day and night.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
