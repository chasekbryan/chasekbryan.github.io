  <p>I will be studying web development through The Odin Project and using this space to document my progress, projects, and key learnings. As I work through the curriculum—from foundational HTML and CSS to JavaScript, Git, and full-stack development—I’ll continuously update this site to reflect my evolving skills. This will serve not only as a record of my journey, but also as a practical demonstration of my ability to build and maintain professional, standards-compliant websites.</p>
