Odin Recipes is a practical showcase of the foundational web development skills I’ve acquired through The Odin Project curriculum. This project represents my ability to structure a website using semantic HTML, organize content effectively, and apply best practices in file structure and linking. Each recipe page demonstrates my understanding of core HTML elements such as headings, lists, images, and internal navigation.

This is an ongoing lab project that I intend to revisit and enhance as I progress through the Odin Project. Future updates will incorporate styling with CSS, accessibility improvements, and possibly the integration of JavaScript for interactivity. Odin Recipes is not only a record of what I’ve learned so far—it’s a living demonstration of my growth as a web developer.
