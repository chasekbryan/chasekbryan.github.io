  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110°F / 45°C)</li>
    <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano (optional)</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
    <li>Your choice of toppings (pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, etc.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir and let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
    <li>Add flour, salt, and olive oil. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1–1.5 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
    <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two portions for thinner crusts or use whole for a thick crust. Roll out into a circle or rectangle on a floured surface.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza peel lined with parchment paper. Add pizza sauce evenly, followed by cheese and your chosen toppings.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven, let cool for a few minutes, add optional fresh basil, slice, and serve warm.</li>
  </ol>
