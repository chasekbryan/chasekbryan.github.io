  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 lean-to-fat ratio recommended)</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter for cooking</li>
    <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>Tomato slices</li>
    <li>Red onion slices</li>
    <li>Dill pickle slices</li>
    <li>Ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and gently shape into patties about ¾ inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent puffing during cooking.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of each patty with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Add oil or butter if using a skillet.</li>
    <li>Cook the patties for 3–4 minutes on the first side. Flip and cook another 3–4 minutes for medium, or adjust time based on desired doneness.</li>
    <li>If using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking and cover to melt.</li>
    <li>Lightly toast the hamburger buns on the skillet or grill for 1–2 minutes until golden.</li>
    <li>Assemble the burgers: place the cooked patty on the bottom bun and layer with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and your preferred condiments.</li>
    <li>Top with the remaining bun half, serve immediately, and enjoy your homemade hamburger.</li>
  </ol>
