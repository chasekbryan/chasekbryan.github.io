      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 pound Italian sausage (optional)</li>
      <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (6 oz) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh basil, chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions, then drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 3–4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef and Italian sausage (if using) to the skillet. Cook until browned, breaking the meat apart as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat and simmer the sauce for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and Parmesan cheese. Mix until smooth and set aside.</li>
      <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, followed by a layer of ricotta mixture, a layer of meat sauce, and a sprinkle of mozzarella. Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and mozzarella on top.</li>
      <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 20–25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes for cleaner portions.</li>
