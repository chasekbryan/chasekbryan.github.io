  <p>This page serves as a curated collection of my personal recipe web pages, each created as part of my ongoing web development training. Every recipe listed here is built using a consistent HTML template, showcasing structured content with headings, images, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions. The purpose of this layout is to demonstrate my ability to apply semantic HTML and organize information in a clear, accessible format. As I continue to refine my skills, these templates may evolve to include enhanced styling, interactivity, and improved usability.</p>
